## Summary
[summary]: #summary

One paragraph explanation of the feature.

## Motivation
[motivation]: #motivation

Why are we doing this? What use cases does it support? What is the expected outcome?

## Guide-level explanation
[guide-level-explanation]: #guide-level-explanation

Explain the proposal as if it was already included and you were teaching it to someone else. That generally means:

- Introducing new named concepts.
- Explaining the feature largely in terms of examples.
- Explaining how users should *think* about the feature, and how it should impact the way they use assister. It should explain the impact as concretely as possible.

## Reference-level explanation
[reference-level-explanation]: #reference-level-explanation

This is the technical portion of the RFC. Explain the design in sufficient detail that:

- Its interaction with other features is clear.
- It is reasonably clear how the feature would be implemented.
- Corner cases are dissected by example.

The section should return to the examples given in the previous section, and explain more fully how the detailed proposal makes those examples work.

## Drawbacks
[drawbacks]: #drawbacks

Why should we *not* do this?

## Rationale and alternatives
[rationale-and-alternatives]: #rationale-and-alternatives

- Why is this design the best in the space of possible designs?
- What other designs have been considered and what is the rationale for not choosing them?
- What is the impact of not doing this?

## Prior art
[prior-art]: #prior-art

Discuss prior art, both the good and the bad, in relation to this proposal.

This section is intended to encourage you as an author to think about the lessons from other projects, provide readers of your RFC with a fuller picture.

If there is no prior art, that is fine - your ideas are interesting to us whether they are brand new or if it is an adaptation from other projects.

## Unresolved questions
[unresolved-questions]: #unresolved-questions

- What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the RFC process before this gets merged?
- What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the implementation of this feature before stabilization?
- What related issues do you consider out of scope for this RFC that could be addressed in the future independently of the solution that comes out of this RFC?
